# Arbixo — conversion notes

This maps the "Easy Journal Accounting System" desktop manual onto the
Next.js + Prisma + Postgres stack, following Business Central conventions
where they diverge from the manual. The web product itself is branded
**Arbixo** ("Accounting Intelligence. Business Excellence." — powered by
Systemaide Solutions Inc.) — the manual is the source material being
converted, not the product name.

## Branding

- `public/arbixo-logo.jpg` — the full logo (icon + wordmark + tagline +
  "Powered by" line), used as-is on the home page hero rather than
  re-typeset, so it stays pixel-faithful to the brand asset.
- `public/arbixo-icon.png` — a cropped icon-only version (just the AR
  mark) for the compact header, generated once via ImageMagick rather
  than re-drawn.
- `tailwind.config.ts` — `brand.navy` / `brand.blue` / `brand.green`,
  colors picked directly off the logo (navy from the "A" and wordmark,
  blue from the "R" gradient, green from the arrow/globe), not a
  freely-chosen palette.
- `components/AppHeader.tsx` — included once in `app/layout.tsx`, so
  every page gets the branded header automatically rather than needing
  it added per-page.
- Primary buttons across every form use `bg-[#0B2A5E]` (brand navy)
  instead of the generic `neutral-900` black used during earlier stages.
  Body text and headings deliberately stay neutral gray — the brand
  color is spent on the header and calls-to-action, not on every
  heading, so dense data tables (the majority of this app) stay
  readable rather than competing with color everywhere.

## What `prisma/schema.prisma` captures

| Manual section | Schema model |
|---|---|
| 1.1 Setup Company | `Company` |
| 3.4 Setup Location (branches) | `Location` |
| 1.2 Chart of Accounts | `Account` — hierarchy, normal balance, opening balance |
| 1.3 Setup Agent | Split into `Customer`, `Vendor`, `Employee`, `Contact` |
| 1.5–1.9 The five journals | `LedgerEntry` — one flat table, `documentNo` groups related lines |
| VAT Computation popup | `VatType`, `grossAmount`/`netAmount`/`vatAmount` on `LedgerEntry` |
| Withholding tax (ATC codes) | `atcCode`, `withholdingAmt` on `LedgerEntry` |
| 1.10 Capital Goods / Importation | dedicated `import*` fields on `LedgerEntry` |
| 4.1 Audit Trail | `AuditLog` |

### LedgerEntry — single flat table, BC G/L Entry style

No separate header/line split. `documentNo` groups every row belonging to
one transaction (one CV, one Invoice, one JV) — the same role BC's
`Document No.` plays on G/L Entry. Each row carries `entryNo`, an immutable
auto-incrementing sequence, as the permanent ledger reference; `journalType`
is the Source Code equivalent (which of the five portals posted it).

### Chart of Accounts — hierarchy + normal balance + opening balance

`Account.parentAccountId`/`children` let "Cash in Bank" be a parent of
"Cash in Bank - BPI", "Cash in Bank - EIB", etc. `normalBalance` is
explicit rather than derived from `classification`, because contra
accounts break the simple mapping — Accumulated Depreciation is
classified as an asset-side account but carries a CREDIT normal balance.
Deferred for later: Posting vs. Heading/Total account types (non-postable
subtotal rows).

### Agent — split into Customer / Vendor / Employee / Contact

The manual's single `Agent` table (with an `AgentType` discriminator)
became four separate tables, matching how BC keeps these as distinct
entities with their own field sets and code sequences rather than one
polymorphic table:

- `Customer` — `customerType`: PRIVATE / GOVERNMENT. Government customers
  trigger the manual's multiple-withholding-tax flow.
- `Vendor` — `vendorType`: SUPPLIER / GOVERNMENT_AGENCY (BIR/SSS/PhilHealth/
  Pag-IBIG remittance payees).
- `Employee` — always an individual; no tax-classification branching.
- `Contact` — catch-all for parties that are none of the above (a lender,
  an owner on an equity drawdown).

`LedgerEntry` links to whichever applies via four optional FKs
(`customerId`/`vendorId`/`employeeId`/`contactId`) plus a
`counterpartyType` enum for convenient filtering without four null-checks.
Only one of the four should be populated per entry — enforced at the API
layer, since Prisma has no native "exactly one of" constraint.

## What's built so far

- **Chart of Accounts** (`app/accounts/`) — tree UI grouped by
  classification, collapsible sub-accounts, inline create/edit/delete.
  API at `app/api/accounts/`.
- **Company setup** (`app/company/setup/`) — singleton settings form
  (POST once to create, PATCH after). API at `app/api/company/`.
- **Agents** (`app/agents/`) — tabbed UI (Customers/Vendors/Employees/
  Contacts) sharing one `PartyManager` component, parameterized by entity
  type since the four models differ (Employee has no tax classification;
  only Customer has `customerType`; only Vendor has `vendorType`). APIs at
  `app/api/customers/`, `app/api/vendors/`, `app/api/employees/`,
  `app/api/contacts/`.
- **VAT / withholding calculator** (`lib/vat.ts`) — pure functions,
  framework-agnostic, verified with `npm test` against the manual's own
  worked examples (page 16, 25, 59). `computeVat` handles the Gross↔Net↔VAT
  three-way split from the manual's "VAT Computation" popup; `computeWithholding`
  applies an ATC rate to the Net amount. Wired into a reusable
  `<VatComputationFields>` component (`components/`) with a standalone
  test harness at `app/tools/vat-calculator/`. ATC rates live in an
  editable `AtcCode` table (`app/api/atc-codes/`) rather than being
  hardcoded — BIR revises these periodically (RR No. 5-2025 and RR No.
  24-2025 both changed creditable withholding rates within the same
  year), so the seed data (`prisma/seed.ts`) is explicitly a starting
  point, not an authoritative table. Verify against
  https://www.bir.gov.ph/WithHoldingTax before relying on it.
- **Tax Posting Setup** (`app/company/tax-posting-setup/`) — tells the
  posting engine which GL accounts to hit for Input VAT, Output VAT,
  Withholding Tax Payable, and Creditable Withholding Tax (four accounts,
  not three — see the Cash Receipts note below for why the withholding
  side needs two separate accounts). The manual does this invisibly;
  here it's explicit and editable, same idea as BC's VAT Posting Setup.
- **Cash Disbursement** (`app/transactions/cash-disbursement/`) — the
  first journal screen, and the one every other journal will borrow its
  shape from:
  - `lib/ledgerPosting.ts` — `postDocument()` is the one function that
    ever calls `prisma.ledgerEntry.create`. It validates double-entry
    balance (to the centavo) and checks the document number isn't
    already used, then writes every line of a document atomically via
    `$transaction` — either the whole document posts or none of it does.
  - The API route (`app/api/ledger-entries/cash-disbursement/`) expands
    each user-entered line into up to four real GL lines: the main line
    (always at Net amount, never Gross — the Gross figure is metadata
    only), an auto Input VAT line if the line has VAT, an auto
    Withholding Payable credit if it has an ATC code, and a single
    balancing Cash credit line at the end.
  - `<CounterpartyPicker>` (`components/`) — Vendor/Employee/Contact/
    Customer selector, needed because `LedgerEntry` has four separate FKs
    instead of one `Agent`. Label is configurable ("Payee" on
    disbursements, "Payor" on receipts, per the manual's own terminology).
  - `<TransactionSummary>` (`components/`) — generic, journal-type-agnostic
    month/year list with cancel, backed by `app/api/ledger-entries/route.ts`
    (Transaction Summary query) and `app/api/ledger-entries/cancel/` — both
    take a `journalType` parameter, so every journal reuses them without
    new endpoints.
- **Cash Receipts** (`app/transactions/cash-receipts/`) — the mirror of
  Cash Disbursement, built second specifically to prove the shared pieces
  (`postDocument`, `<VatComputationFields>`, `<CounterpartyPicker>`,
  `<TransactionSummary>`) actually generalize rather than needing a
  rewrite. One genuine asymmetry, not just a debit/credit flip: when a
  **customer** withholds tax from paying **us**, the withheld amount is
  an ASSET (Creditable Withholding Tax — offsets our income tax due
  later), not the same liability account Cash Disbursement credits when
  *we* withhold from a vendor. Confirmed against the manual's own
  screenshots — Cash Receipts labels that column "WITAX (DEBIT)" where
  Cash Disbursement labels it "W/TAX (CREDIT)". `TaxPostingSetup` now has
  four accounts, not three, to keep these separate.
- **Sales on Account / Purchases on Account**
  (`app/transactions/sales/`, `app/transactions/purchases/`) — same shape
  as the two cash journals, but nothing changes hands yet: the balancing
  line hits Accounts Receivable (Sales, debit) or Accounts Payable
  (Purchases, credit) instead of a cash account, so there's no "which
  bank account" picker at all. Settlement happens later as a separate
  Cash Receipts/Disbursement entry against the same customer/vendor.
  - **Sales Return / Purchase Return** are implemented as the normal
    entry, reversed — not a separate rule set. `flipLines()`
    (`lib/vatLineExpansion.ts`) swaps every line's debit and credit after
    the normal expansion runs, and `documentType` switches to
    `CREDIT_MEMO`. This matches the manual's own description: "the same
    steps... except clicking the Sales Return button."
  - Refactored `lib/vatLineExpansion.ts` out of the two cash journals'
    routes at this point, once a third and fourth journal needed the same
    line-expansion logic — `expandVatLines()` takes a `direction`
    (`DEBIT` for money-out journals, `CREDIT` for money-in journals) and
    produces the main + VAT + withholding companion lines; each journal's
    route just adds its own balancing line (Cash, AR, or AP) on top.
- **General Journal** (`app/transactions/general-journal/`) — the fifth
  and final journal, and deliberately the odd one out: no auto VAT/
  withholding expansion at all. The manual's own General Journal use
  cases (capital goods purchases, importation, and critically, closing
  Input/Output VAT to VAT Payable) require the user to pick *both* sides
  of the entry directly — the VAT-closing entries specifically need the
  VAT-computation prompt **declined**, which only makes sense if the
  journal doesn't force it on every line. The optional per-line VAT
  calculator here is informational only (tags gross/net/VAT/ATC for BIR
  reports via small "Use net/VAT → Debit/Credit" buttons that just fill
  the amount fields) — it never posts a companion line the way the other
  four journals' calculators do. `postDocument`'s balance check is the
  only thing enforcing correctness here, since there's no auto-generated
  balancing line either; the UI disables Save until debit = credit.

All five journals from the manual are now built: Cash Disbursement, Cash
Receipts, Sales on Account, Purchases on Account, General Journal.
- **General Ledger + Trial Balance** (`app/reports/general-ledger/`,
  `app/reports/trial-balance/`) — the first reports built on top of the
  five journals, and the payoff for `postDocument`'s balance guarantee:
  `lib/reports.ts` computes both from `LedgerEntry` directly, no separate
  balance-tracking table needed.
  - Both work in a "debit-positive" internal convention — a positive
    number always means a debit balance, negative means credit,
    regardless of the account's own `normalBalance`. This matters because
    a trial balance should show an account's *actual* sign (e.g. a bank
    overdraft on a normally-debit Cash account should show as a credit),
    not force it into a "designed" column.
  - Trial Balance has the manual's two modes: Year-to-Date (opening
    balance + everything ever posted up to a date — what should tie to
    the Balance Sheet) and Current Net Change (movement within a period
    only, no opening balance). The UI shows a live "debits equal credits"
    check — this should always be true across every account, since every
    document that ever posted through `postDocument()` was already
    balanced going in. If it's ever false, something bypassed the posting
    engine.
  - Caught and fixed a date-range bug while building this: filtering with
    `postingDate: { lt: dateTo }` on a date-only value (no time
    component) silently excludes every entry on the "to" day itself. Used
    `lte` instead, since `postingDate` is always stored at midnight from
    a date-only input.
- **Debtors' / Creditors' Ledger** (`app/reports/subsidiary-ledger/`) —
  a customer's or vendor's Accounts Receivable/Payable movements
  specifically, not every ledger line tagged with that party.
  `getSubsidiaryLedger()` filters by BOTH the party (`customerId` or
  `vendorId`) AND the account's `classification`
  (`ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE`/`ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE`) — without the classification
  filter, a Sales entry's Income line and AR line are both tagged with
  the same customer, and summing both would double-count rather than
  show what they actually owe. Structurally almost identical to
  `getGeneralLedger()` (same beginning-balance + running-balance shape),
  just keyed on a party instead of a single account, and able to span
  multiple AR/AP accounts for that party if more than one exists.
- **Income Statement / Balance Sheet** (`app/reports/income-statement/`,
  `app/reports/balance-sheet/`) — both derived from the same
  `getAccountNetMovements()` helper that `getTrialBalance()` uses, now
  extracted into a shared function since three reports needed it.
  - Income Statement is always period-based (Revenue/Expense are
    temporary accounts) — no opening balance folded in, ever.
  - Balance Sheet has a subtlety worth understanding before you touch it:
    this system never automates the real-world year-end "close" (zeroing
    Revenue/Expense into `EQUITY_GETS_CLOSED` via a General Journal
    entry). A naive Balance Sheet that only adds the *current* fiscal
    year's net income to Equity would fail to balance the moment a prior
    year's books haven't been closed — assets/liabilities are cumulative
    since inception, but a current-year-only earnings figure isn't.
    Fixed by computing net income twice — once since the earliest posted
    entry (all-time), once for just the current fiscal year — and
    showing the difference as its own "Prior years' unclosed earnings"
    line. This makes the sheet balance unconditionally (provided opening
    balances were themselves entered in a balanced way) while surfacing
    a real signal: a nonzero value there means "close your books for that
    year," not "this calculation is broken."
  - Both reports show a live balance check, same as Trial Balance — for
    Balance Sheet specifically, Assets = Liabilities + Equity should
    always hold given the above.

## Authentication

- **Sessions are stateless signed JWTs** (`lib/auth.ts`), not rows in a
  database table — deliberate, because `middleware.ts` checks auth on
  every request and runs on the Edge runtime, which can't reach Postgres
  through Prisma. Verifying a JWT's signature needs no database call.
  The tradeoff, stated plainly: no way to force-expire a single session
  before its 7-day cookie expiry (no revocation list). A real "sign out
  everywhere" feature would need to reintroduce a DB-backed denylist.
- **Password hashing lives in its own file** (`lib/password.ts`),
  deliberately separate from `lib/auth.ts`. Middleware imports from
  `lib/auth.ts`; keeping bcryptjs out of that file means the Edge bundle
  never needs to include it, even though bcryptjs happens to be pure JS
  with no native bindings that would break on Edge anyway.
- **Flow**: `/register` (email + password) → creates an unverified user,
  generates a 6-digit code, emails it (or logs it to the console if
  `RESEND_API_KEY` isn't set) → `/verify` (enter the code) → auto-logs in
  on success. Re-registering an email that's never been verified
  overwrites the password and resends a fresh code rather than erroring
  — someone who mistyped their password or lost the first code shouldn't
  get stuck.
- **Global admin account**: `prisma/seed.ts` upserts one pre-verified
  `ADMIN` user from `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`, since there's no one
  else yet to send a verification email to on a fresh deployment.
- **`middleware.ts`** redirects any request without a valid session to
  `/login`, for everything except `/login`, `/register`, `/verify`, and
  `/api/auth/*`.
- **Known consideration, not yet addressed**: `/register` is open —
  anyone who finds the URL can create an account and, once verified, see
  this company's full financial data. That's fine for solo testing but
  worth revisiting before handing this to anyone else: either gate
  registration behind an admin invite, or add a `role`-based check
  (`User.role` already exists) restricting which pages a `USER` vs
  `ADMIN` can reach. Neither is built yet — every logged-in user
  currently has identical access.

## Navigation redesign

- **Route groups, not a URL change**: every existing page moved from
  `app/<section>/` to `app/(app)/<section>/` — parenthesized folders are
  invisible to the URL, so `/accounts` is still `/accounts`. This let the
  authenticated pages share one layout (header + sidebar) while
  `app/(auth)/login` etc. get a separate, minimal layout with neither.
  Nothing needed to change inside the moved page files themselves, since
  every internal import already used the `@/` absolute alias rather than
  relative paths — only relative-path imports would have broken from the
  move.
- **`lib/navigation.ts`** is the single source of truth for the sidebar's
  sections/links — previously the home page had its own hardcoded copy
  of the same list, which is exactly the kind of duplication that drifts
  out of sync the first time someone adds a page and forgets one of the
  two places. The home page no longer needs its own nav grid at all,
  now that the sidebar is present on every page.
- **`components/Sidebar.tsx`**: BC-style collapsible groups (click a
  section header to expand/collapse its links, independent of the
  sidebar's own collapsed state), plus a separate collapse toggle that
  shrinks the whole sidebar to an icon-only rail. Collapsed state
  persists to `localStorage` across visits. Deliberately *not* built as
  an overlay/drawer — it's a real flex sibling of the content area, so
  collapsing it reflows the page rather than covering it, closer to how
  a docked desktop nav pane behaves than a mobile hamburger drawer.

## Database and deployment

- **Local testing**: `docker-compose.yml` runs Postgres 16 locally.
  `.env.example` → `.env` already matches its credentials. See
  `DEPLOYMENT.md` for the full walkthrough (start Postgres → `npx prisma
  db push` → seed → run → first-time setup steps in the app itself).
- **`db push` vs. `migrate dev`**: this project uses `prisma db push` for
  now — it syncs the database to `schema.prisma` directly with no
  migration history, which is the right tool while the schema is still
  moving. `DEPLOYMENT.md` explains when to switch to `migrate dev`
  (multiple contributors, need for reviewable history, approaching a real
  production launch).
- **Vercel deployment**: needs a hosted Postgres (Vercel Postgres or
  Neon — use Neon's *pooled* connection string, since serverless
  functions open a new connection per request and exhaust an unpooled
  connection limit fast) and the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set
  in the Vercel dashboard.
- **A real gotcha, fixed proactively**: `prisma generate` is wired into
  both `postinstall` and the `build` script. Skipping this is the single
  most common reason a Prisma+Vercel app deploys "successfully" and then
  500s on the first database call — Vercel caches `node_modules`, and if
  `generate` only ran once and the cache hits, the generated client can
  go stale against schema changes.
- **A second real gotcha, hit during actual deployment testing**: every
  page in this app is a Server Component that queries Prisma directly,
  with no route segment config. Next.js's default behavior is to try to
  *statically pre-render* pages like that at build time — which means
  running real database queries inside the Vercel build container, where
  `DATABASE_URL` either isn't set or the database isn't reachable. The
  build failed with `Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL` on
  every single page that touches Prisma (16 of them). Fixed with one line
  on the root layout (`export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`) rather
  than repeating it in every page file — this app is entirely live
  database state, so nothing in it should ever be statically generated in
  the first place. Setting `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel is still required —
  this fix only moves when it's needed from "during the build" to "when a
  real request comes in," which is the correct time for a live app.
- **`.gitignore` was missing** until this stage — an oversight from the
  very first commit, since this project didn't have a real deployment
  target yet. Fixed now, before this goes anywhere near a real Git repo;
  double-check `git status` never shows `.env` before your first commit.
- **A third gap, found from the deployed screenshot itself**: the root
  URL `/` 404'd even after a successful deployment, because every stage
  built a feature page under a subpath (`/accounts`, `/transactions/...`,
  `/reports/...`) and none of them created `app/page.tsx` — there was
  simply no page registered for `/` at all. Added a home page
  (`app/page.tsx`) that checks whether a company exists yet and links out
  to every section. Doubles as a quick smoke test after any deploy: if it
  loads and correctly shows either "no company set up" or the company's
  trade name, `DATABASE_URL` is working end to end in production.

## BIR compliance reports

- **Monthly VAT Return** (`app/reports/bir/vat-return/`, BIR Form 2550M
  shape) — the first BIR-specific report, computed from `LedgerEntry`
  rather than the general-purpose queries in `lib/reports.ts`.
  - Deliberately mirrors a limitation stated in the manual itself, quoted
    directly: *"The system will only take up the current transactions as
    the basis of computing Vat Payable. Any adjustments coming from
    previous period will be manually encoded."* Rather than inventing
    carryover-tracking logic the source system doesn't have either,
    "Input Tax Carried Over from Previous Period" is a manual input field
    here too, exactly matching the original.
  - Splits Vatable Sales into Private vs. Government using
    `Customer.customerType` — this is exactly why that field exists.
  - **Known simplification, stated honestly rather than faked**: the
    manual's form splits purchases into Capital Goods / Goods / Services
    using a Tax Source captured at entry time. The schema already has
    this field (`LedgerEntry.taxSource`, the `GOODS`/`SERVICE`/
    `CAPITAL_GOODS` enum), but none of the four journal entry screens
    populate it yet — `VatComputationFields` doesn't currently ask for
    it. Until that's wired up, this report only reliably separates
    Capital Goods (via the debited account's `FIXED_ASSET`
    classification) from everything else, rather than presenting a
    Goods/Services split with no real data behind it.

None of these have auth wired up yet — every server component currently
does `prisma.company.findFirst()` rather than deriving the company from a
session. Each page has a `// TODO` marking this.

## Business logic worth calling out (don't lose these in translation)

- **VAT math**: gross = net × 1.12 (or net = gross / 1.12), VAT = gross − net.
  This single calculation is reused across all five journals — build it
  once as a shared function, not five times.
- **Auto-numbering**: CV no., OR no., Invoice no., PV no., JV no. are all
  system-suggested but editable. Use a per-company, per-journal-type counter.
- **VAT-registration gating**: 12% VAT / Zero-Rated / VAT Exempt options
  should only appear if the counterparty's `registrationType` is `VAT`;
  otherwise force `NON_VAT`. Same rule for "Importation" — only offered
  when the payee/supplier is `NON_VAT` (assumed foreign).
- **Split VAT lines**: one expense/sales account can have two lines — one
  `VAT_12`, one `VAT_EXEMPT` — for a single transaction split partly taxable.
- **Multiple withholding lines**: government sales can carry two ATC/WHT
  rows against one gross amount (manual section on "Government Sale with
  multiple Withholding taxes") — this is exactly why `Customer.customerType`
  has a GOVERNMENT value.
- **Manual VAT closing entries**: closing Input Tax/Output Tax to VAT
  Payable is a plain General Journal entry with VAT-computation *declined*
  (the "No" prompt) — don't force the VAT popup on every Input/Output line.
- **Location vs. consolidation**: branches get their own `Location`, but
  virtually every report defaults to consolidated across locations — filter
  by location only when explicitly asked.
- **Periodic inventory**: this system does not track a running Inventory
  ledger; COGS is computed at period-end, not per-transaction. Don't build
  a perpetual-inventory model unless you intend to change that policy.
- **Decimal serialization**: any Prisma record with a `Decimal` field
  (`Account.openingBalance`, `AtcCode.ratePercent`, every monetary field
  on `LedgerEntry`) throws at runtime if passed directly as a prop from a
  Server Component to a Client Component — Decimal.js instances aren't
  in React's list of serializable types. Wrap with `toPlain()`
  (`lib/serialize.ts`) before passing down. Every future journal screen
  will hit this the moment it fetches accounts or ATC codes server-side.

## What to build next

The Monthly VAT Return (2550M/2550Q) is the first BIR form done. Test the
deployment (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`) before going further — everything past
this point builds on the assumption that posting and reporting actually
work end to end against a real database, not just in theory. After that:

1. Wire up `LedgerEntry.taxSource` (Goods/Service/Capital Goods) in the
   Cash Disbursement and Purchases entry screens — the VAT return's
   purchases split depends on it, and it's a schema field that already
   exists but nothing populates yet.
2. 1601E/1601F (withholding remittance) and the Monthly Alphalist of
   Payees — pulls from `LedgerEntry.atcCode`/`withholdingAmt`, grouped by
   vendor, structurally similar to the VAT return.
3. 2307/2306 certificates — per-transaction or per-quarter withholding
   certificates for a specific vendor/customer.
4. SLS/SLP (Summary Lists of Sales/Purchases) and the RELIEF/MAP data
   file export — these read the same underlying data as the VAT return
   but need a specific file format (BIR's DAT file layout) rather than
   an on-screen report.

## Deferred / known gaps

- Editing or deleting an already-posted document isn't built yet — only
  cancel (soft, via `isCancelled`). Editing a document that auto-generated
  Input VAT/Withholding companion lines means deleting and regenerating
  all of them, not just patching one row; worth designing deliberately
  rather than bolting on.
- Counterparty is currently attached to every "main" line plus the
  balancing cash line, but not to the auto-generated Input VAT/Withholding
  companion lines (those are impersonal control accounts). Revisit if you
  want per-vendor withholding remittance reports.
- Invoice numbers and Credit Memo numbers share the same numbering
  namespace right now (`documentNo` is unique per `companyId` +
  `journalType`, and Sales Returns post under `journalType:
  SALES_ON_ACCOUNT` same as regular invoices). The manual shows "Invoice
  no." and "CM No." as two visually separate fields, suggesting two
  independent sequences. Doesn't break double-entry correctness, but
  worth a dedicated `documentType`-aware uniqueness constraint if you
  want Invoice #1001 and CM #1001 to coexist.
